Mock Climate Change and Forced Migration in South Asia

Participated in a high-level academic simulation focused on climate-induced migration in South Asia. As the European Union delegate, I delivered a policy speech, proposed international cooperation strategies, and engaged in multilateral discussions. Emphasized EU support through climate finance, technology transfer, and alignment with global frameworks like the Paris Agreement and Global Compact for Migration.
